    Predicting the future development of time series is of interest in different
    areas of computational biology. The time series in biological systems exhibit
    challenging characteristics such as chaotic or stochastic behavior. In this
    report, time series forecasting and generation
    is done on several kinds of biological time
    series using deep neural networks. We compare classical multi layer
    perceptrons with recurrent and convolutional architectures.
    In our evaluation, we identify challenges
    and limitations of neural networks for these tasks,
    and compare different architectures of
    deep neural networks with regard to their performance. We conclude that
    the configuration of the optimization algorithm has strong impact on the 
    results, independent of the architecture. The nature of the noise in the 
    data has also strong influence. We also show 
    that a generation of stochastic time series is not possible using
    deterministic neural networks, because only the mean of the probability
    distribution can be estimated. The code used in our experiments can be found 
    on \href{https://github.com/ChipsSpectre/TimeSeriesPrediction}{GitHub}.
