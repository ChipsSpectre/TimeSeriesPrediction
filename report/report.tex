\begin{abstract}
    Predicting the future development of time series is of interest in different
    areas of computational biology. The time series in biological models exhibit
    challenging characteristics such as chaotic or stochastic behavior. In this
    report, time series prediction is done on different kind of biological time
    series using deep neural networks. In our evaluation, we identify challenges
    and limitations of this approach, and compare different architectures of
    deep neural networks with regard to their performance.
